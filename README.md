Low-level Mangadex v5 API Node Library

This project simply has typing information and functions to hit most endpoints on the API; basically translating their yaml file to a functional Node interface.

Don't expect this to be a full-featured wrapper with things like a "client" to keep track of your login session or anything like that since that's not what this is for.

Credits to the MangaDex team for all the hard work they do
